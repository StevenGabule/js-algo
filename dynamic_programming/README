fib program
Write a function `fib(n)` that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return
the n-th number of the fibonacci sequence.

The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1. To generate the next number of sequence,
we sum the previous two.

fib(n): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
